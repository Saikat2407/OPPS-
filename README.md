<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

class - class is short of a templete of object.

object - object are the instance of a class.

instence variable - variable inside the object are called as the instance variable.

student[] Saikat = new student[]; => `new` -> dynamically allocates memory and return a reference to it.

student[]; -> Constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects of a class.

this ->  `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object instance. 

In java primitive data types are stored in stack memory.

`final` -> final keyword makes the object value constant(It cannot be modified). You can't change the value if you had used final keyword.

`static` -> when a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any of the object is being is created before refrencing to that object. static variable doesn't depend on the object.

Singleton class -> means you are allowed to create only one object.

Inheritance -> when child class inherit properties of base class then it is called as inheritance.

Child class -> is a class that is created by inheriting or extending the features of another class, which is called the "base class".
             
-> child class will have base class properties and properties of its own.

`super` -> super keyword is used to reference the class which is above the current class.

Base class -> base class is a parent class or superclass through which child class extend the properties of base class.

Single inheritance -> one class extends another class or base class having one child class.

Multilevel inheritance -> in multilevel inheritance every class will be acting as a base class to the classes that are below to the other.

Multiple inheritance -> when the child class is being extended from two base class that is known as multiple inheritance.

In multiple inheritance if one parent class **A** assign n = 3 and other parent class **B** assign n = 0, then child class **C**.n will not be able to decide which n to choose that why there is no Multiple inheritance in Java.

`Java doesn't suppport multiple inheritance`

Hierachial inheritance -> one class is inherited from multiple class. E.g. Multiple child class is being inherited from base class or any other base class.

Hybrid inheritance -> combination of single and multiple inheritance. 

`Java doesn't suppport Hybrid inheritance`

Cyclic inheritance -- A class cannot be its own super class.

`Java doesn't suppport Cyclic inheritance`

class - class is short of a templete of object.

object - object are the instance of a class.

instence variable - variable inside the object are called as the instence varibale.

student[] saikat = new student[]; => `new` -> dynamically allocates memory and return a refrence to it.

student[]; -> Constructer is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects of a class.

this ->  `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object instance. 

In java primitive datatypes are stored in stack memory.

`final` -> final keyword makes the object value constant(It cannot be modified). You can't change the value if you had used final keyword.

`static` -> when a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any of the object is being is created before refrencing to that object. static variable doesn't depend on the object.

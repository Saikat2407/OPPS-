class - class is short of a templete of object.

object - object are the instance of a class.

instence variable - variable inside the object are called as the instence varibale.

student[] Saikat = new student[]; => `new` -> dynamically allocates memory and return a refrence to it.

student[]; -> Constructer is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects of a class.

this ->  `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object instance. 

In java primitive datatypes are stored in stack memory.

`final` -> final keyword makes the object value constant(It cannot be modified). You can't change the value if you had used final keyword.

`static` -> when a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any of the object is being is created before refrencing to that object. static variable doesn't depend on the object.

Singleton class -> means you are allowed to create only one object.

Inheritance -> when child class inherit properties of base class then it is called as inheritance.

Child class -> is a class that is created by inheriting or extending the features of another class, which is called the "base class".
             
-> child class will have base class properties and properties of its own.

`super` -> super keyword is used to reference the class which is above the current class.

Base class -> base class is a parent class or superclass through which child class extend the properties of base class.
